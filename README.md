# gitwalker

## ideas

 - Discontinue this project and merge into `watchcat`.

## to-dos

 - [ ] limit depth of search for git repos with option.
 - [ ] show when changes have not been pushed to the remote repository.
 - [ ] have a weak scan mode which allows to ignore git repos that have a `.nogitwalk` file in the repo root.
